# Deep Learning based Intelligent Connectivity for Mobility Management
Predict the user's next location with pytorch machine learning models

## Purpose
- explore how to use different deep learning techniques
- predict the user's next location
- prepare the pre-work for Handover in advance
- solve the degradation of service quality and energy loss caused by passive handover of traditional base stations
- comparing the prediction accuracy of LSTM, GRU, and TCN in the dataset of simulated trajectories

## Dataset
use the the paper(SMOOTH:A Simple Way to Model Human Mobility) algorithm to generate the dataset

## Environment
- Linux
- RTX 3080
- python 3.8
